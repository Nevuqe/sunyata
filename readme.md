# Sunyata

Sunyata is an open-source foundational operating system, combining the Zircon kernel developed at Google (by the Fuchsia team) with components from FreeBSD. Sunyata runs on x86-64 (Intel), ARM, and RISC-V.

This is currently an ongoing project which as only just started, pull-requests are welcome if you would like to contribute.
